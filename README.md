# CobolNeuralNet
I took my Fortran neural net and rewrote the whole thing in Cobol.
This is another example of me writing a neural net to teach myself a language I didn't previously know.

Like the Fortran neural net, this one was also written in an Arch Linux environment. To compile this program, run cobc -x -free -O suffering.cob (or whatever the filename currently is).
